## About Me

I am a Data Science student at National Economics University with a focus on applying artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies to develop transparent and data-driven financial solutions. My research interests center on fraud detection in cryptocurrency networks, particularly Ethereum blockchain transactions.

Currently, I serve as a Research Intern at Business AI Lab, National Economics University, where I work on advanced fraud detection systems. My research involves reproducing and analyzing state-of-the-art models including BERT4ETH, Dynamic Feature Fusion, and ZipZap. I am developing a novel Language Model + Graph Model pipeline combined with Temporal Analysis that has achieved an F1-score of 94%, representing a 2% improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.

My academic journey has been complemented by practical applications of AI technology for social impact. I won the Biztech Hackathon 2025 by developing SUPERVISION, an AI-powered mobile application that assists visually impaired users with navigation through YOLOv11 Nano for real-time obstacle detection. 

I actively contribute to the academic community through mentoring roles in the Fulbright STEM Program, where I guide undergraduate students in their academic and career development. Additionally, I have served as a Media Ambassador for the Future Business Analyst Competition at RMIT University Vietnam, where I led a cross-cultural team in developing strategic solutions for social impact initiatives.

I am seeking research opportunities and collaborations in artificial intelligence, blockchain applications, fraud detection, and computer vision technologies that create meaningful social impact.
