## About Me

I am an AI researcher focused on building agentic, reliable, and efficient AI systems. My current interests include Generative AI, multimodal models (text–image–signal–structured data), and multi-agent frameworks powered by LLMs for knowledge-intensive reasoning. I also explore predictive representation learning (JEPA-style objectives) for compact, transferable embeddings.

At AIoT Lab (Phenikaa University), I have designed and deployed multi-agent systems for multi-document summarization, integrating RAG/GraphRAG and knowledge graphs to improve factuality and coverage. At Business AI Lab (NEU), I conduct multimodal AI research for healthcare and business, focusing on data fusion for decision support and trustworthy analytics; I also serve on the core proposal team to help draft research proposals and secure funding.

I value collaboration and open science. I’m looking to work with advisors and teams on agentic LLMs, multimodal fusion, JEPA-style representation learning, and efficient LLM serving (e.g., vLLM, QLoRA/AWQ, KV-cache optimization) with real-world impact in healthcare and business.
